This was a banking investment calculator application that can help people see how their money grows over time. You just input your initial investment, monthly deposits, annual interest rate, and the number of years you're planning to invest. 
The program will calcuate the numbers and show you how your balance and interest grow each year, both with and without those monthly deposits. It's all about making the concept of compound interest more feasible so people can make smarter financial choices. 
I feel like I did a good job keeping the code clean and organized, especially by using classes and functions to separate different parts of the program. I think I could beef up the exception handling to ensure that user input wont cause any crashes. 
I could maybe add some features like variable interest rates or factoring in inflation to make it more realistic. The hardest part was definitely getting the input validation just rightâ€”it was a bit tricky to make sure it could handle all sorts of incorrect 
inputs without freaking out. After I did some research on stack overflow I found found resources, and managed to get it working smoothly. Overall, the project helped me sharpen my object-oriented programming skills and problem-solving abilities.
